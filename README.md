# django_blog
blog app made with Python and Django - from the Djangogirls tutorial

Deployed at: https://pieguy.pythonanywhere.com/

This app follows the web version of the Django Girls Tutorial (https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) for building a web app. It is easier to follow than the Django Docs tutorial for a beginner, thought the latter is more thorough.

One of the best things about this tutorial is that it walks you through deploying two different ways: quick and dirty (not secure) through PythonAnywhere.com and also through Heroku.  As of Feb. 22, 2019, this app is only deployed on PythonAnywhere at https://pieguy.pythonanywhere.com/

One of the best things about Django is the built in admin access!!  Wow! Wow! Wow!  Love, love, love this feature.  It almost feels like cheating coming from Rails.  It is the whole reason for using frameworks, though! But then why don't we all use Wordpress?!?!
