# django_blog
blog app made with Python and Django - from the Djangogirls tutorial

Deployed at: https://pieguy.pythonanywhere.com/

This app follows the web version of the Django Girls Tutorial (https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) for building a web app. It is easier to follow than the Django Docs tutorial for a beginner, thought the latter is more thorough.

One of the best things about this tutorial is that it walks you through deploying two different ways: quick and dirty (not secure) through PythonAnywhere.com and also through Heroku.  As of Feb. 22, 2019, this app is only deployed on PythonAnywhere at https://pieguy.pythonanywhere.com/
